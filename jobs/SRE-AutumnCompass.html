To enable this, we utilise the latest developments in machine learning, automation, market modelling and software engineering.

As a young, growing and fast-moving company, our engineers, scientists and strategists bring new ideas into existence and continually challenge the status-quo. We hire exceptional individuals who enjoy problem solving, possess deep curiosity and can see the big picture while working out fine details.

# Overview

We are looking for an experienced Software Engineer, specifically a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to join the Data Platforms and Data Operations team at Autumn Compass. In the Site Reliability Engineer role you will be working with our cloud distributed compute infrastructure which powers our trading research. This platform forms a foundational component of our business and so it is important we are able to keep it performant, reliable and flexible.

With no external clients and a culture of devops, you will work with the team through the entire lifecycle of our platform’s new features, from design to release and post rollout maintenance, specialising as a Software Engineer in the Data Operations division.

# Software Engineer (Data Operations) Responsibilities:

* Ensuring our compute infrastructure is reliable, fault-tolerant and can scale across 1000s of compute systems.

* Evolving our systems to improve robustness and correctness through the use of new technology, automation and simplification.
* Leading our team’s approach to devops by developing our philosophy and bringing our approach in line with best practices.
* Willingness to challenge the status quo to bring new ideas and innovation to the team.

# Software Engineer (Data Operations) Profile:

* 3+ years of experience working in a DevOps/SRE team.
* Development experience in Python (or a similar language) and a willingness to work with Python infrastructure.
* Knowledge of best practice in DevOps and the interest to stay on top of the changes in the space
* Expertise in designing, architecting, and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
* Systematic problem-solving approach, coupled with effective communication skills and a sense of drive.
* Understanding of Unix/Linux operating systems.
* Experience with the AWS stack is desirable

# Perks

* Infrastructure is important but non-critical (with a large error budge) so no on-call required.
* Flexible work hours
* Breakfast, lunch, snacks, groceries and daily coffee all provided
* Pool table, ping pong table, console and board games
* Flat management structure, report to the CTO
* Towel service and showers provided
* Central CBD location (next to Fitness First gym)
